# paper-grabber
A python script to scrape papers by date from BioRxiv collections and output to a csv file

Python version: 3.x

Dependencies/Libraries: 
requests
bs4 (for BeautifulSoup)
pandas

Output file path is formatted for Windows

Recommended usage:
I run this in Pycharm (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) and add/change parameters within the script directly (see commented user specific inputs). 
Dependencies can be installed in Pycharm before running. 
Works well when run on Windows. I haven't tested it with Mac or Linux.
